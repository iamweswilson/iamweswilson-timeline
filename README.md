This is my personal site's repo, feel free to take what you want.

## Here's how you install the site locally. Make sure you have npm, then do the following:

### Install vuepress globally

```
npm install -g vuepress
```

### Install npm packages

```
npm install
```

### Run vuepress ('site' tells it where to look)

```
vuepress dev site
```

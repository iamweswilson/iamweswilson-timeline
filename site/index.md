  intro: >
    This is my attempt at being open and honest about the experiences that have
    shaped my career. Minor successes, lessons learned, miscalculations... all
    of it. (Side note: I left off my personal milestones including marrying my
    wife, raising 3 kids and a cross-country move to Portland to name a few. If
    you really want to hear about any of that, I'm happy to share over a
    beverage.) There is real value in people being vulnerable, sharing their
    failures alongside their successes. As Yoda once said, “The greatest
    teacher, failure is.”

      Since being founded in 2012, the OpenStack Foundation has not had it's own identity. The foundation's sole purpose was to support the OpenStack software project so a unique identity would've countered the mission. Now that OSF has expanded its focus, hosting other projects and driving forward open infrastrucutre, a unique identity was needed to differentiate the foundation from the software. First steps in that process: a new logo and website. Luckily, I get to work with tremendous designers and developers that can bring the vision to life.

      This site started off as a fun side project to get my hands further into
      serverless development. It turned into a writing exercise and deep dive
      into forgotten experiences. From the technical side, it's built off of a
      set of tools that we cobbled together for OSF pilot projects including
      Vuepress, Bulma, Buefy and Netlify CMS. Feel free to dig into the code,
      take what you want and send any ideas. Please don't giggle too loudly at
      all of the trial and error that's happening in my commits.

      Then rewrote and rewrote and rewrote and rewrote and rewrote. The rewrites
      were absolutely the right call, even though they happened the night before
      it went on stage in front of 2,500+. I had no idea I'd be on stage and
      would not have selected a hoodie to wear if I had known.

      I had the chance to work with some amazing designers like Joe Basnight,
      illustrators like Lola Scarpatti and event managers (looking at you
      FNtech.) We introduced the term “open infrastructure”, which would become
      OSF’s primary category moving forward. We move locations and reinvent the
      design theme for every Summit every 6 months. Each one is a labor of love
      and a lot of work. The team makes all the difference.

      And by "expanded" I mean we went from one full time designer (me) to two,
      with additional support from freelance contractors. I have always been
      proud of what we've been able to accomplish with such a lean crew
      supporting OpenStack, OpenStack Foundation and now a handful of new pilot
      projects including Airship, Kata Containers, StarlingX and Zuul.

      Working with arguably the greatest team ever assembled. For the first time
      in my career I was able to focus on one skillset... graphic design. UI,
      events, collateral, keynotes and more. I gave myself permission to fully
      trust my teammates and it paid off. My eyes were opened to how much impact
      the right team could have when combined with the right amount of autonomy.
      We were making an impact on hugely impactful organizations like CERN,
      Walmart, Nike, BMW, Blizzard Entertainment, Baidu and more.

      Worked mostly with startups and Texas firms doing UI/UX work and the
      occasional logo design. I quicky discovered I’m not a great designer when
      I’m juggling clients. My head needs to be fully invested in something for
      me to be worth a crap. I need to be all in or not at all.

      Think Slack before there was Slack. We posted a group chat concept on
      HackerNews and saw 2,000 signups overnight. Naively, we decided that was
      enough to quit our jobs and make a startup run. Investors told us there
      was "no market in chat", which we believed. We shifted from group chat to
      customer service without any real differentiation in the market. I
      experienced nearly one year of startup pains with two of the greatest
      people I know. Awesomatic, through the perseverance of one of our
      co-founders, made it into an incubator in Cincinati called Brandery. It
      fizzled out shortly after.

      Techstars opened one of their signature startup incubator programs in San
      Antonio as a means to attract and create cloud-based startups. San Antonio
      became a temporary home to some exciting startups like Cloudability,
      Keen.io and Distil. At the time I was pretty tied into the local startup
      community, so I was asked to be a mentor. Imposter syndrome run wild!

      Previously known as ZippKid (a name purchased through BrandStack), we
      provided Wordpress hosting in the hay day of Wordpress. I wasn't a
      co-founder in the traditional sense of the word. I came on to help the
      real founder, a close friend of mine. I didn’t yet see the value in
      allowing others to contribute to any success, so “staying in my lane” and
      working with a partner was tough. Thus my next startup attempt. Later,
      Pressable obtained significant investment from Automattic (creators of
      WordPress.) They stripped the team and are currently operating under new
      management.

      At a loss. Techcrunch described it as us being “pulled from the deadpool”
      which wasn't entirely incorrect. It wasn't the outcome I had hoped for,
      but selling allowed me to get right with my customers and it took some
      major stress off of my shoulders. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make my
      investors whole. I experienced unbeleiveable stress in the months leading
      to this date. Did you know that excess stress can trigger all sorts of
      auto-immune issues such as allopecia and shingles? It can. Take care of
      yourselves.

      Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite the article I was hoping for. I was
      unprepared for the security risks that come with a startup online
      marketplace. And remember, this was before SaSS services like Stripe that
      help combat credit card fraud. It went like this... One user hires
      themselves on UpStack using a stolen credit card, pretending to be
      separate users. They complete the project quickly, so we send the
      "designer" their payment. Owner of the credit card reports the stolen
      funds. Bank takes funds from us, even though we already paid the funds out
      to the designer. This happened in a short period of time to the tune of
      almost $100k, meaning I no longer have cash in the bank and the model
      wasn't strong enough to encourage further investment. Time to shut it
      down.

      Sister product to BrandStack, later named BrandStack Custom, that utilized
      our pool of 30k designers to create custom designs for clients through our
      project management portal. We even ate our own dog food and purchased the
      logo from a designer on BrandStack. While great in concept, UpStack's
      operational needs eventually led to our downfall.

      Designer, illustrator and writer. I micromanaged the hell out of them. I
      honestly had no idea how to manage people, so I started every day with a
      standup (which is very managerial), but then gave daily tasks. I gave no
      autonomy, which prevented them from helping me grow. They took it like
      champs. I still heart all of them and love following their success.

      Raised seed round of funding from 2 founders of Rackspace. Stumbled into
      that relationship and didn't realize raising at that scale was possible
      until I met them. Part of the process included rebranding IncSpring to
      BrandStack, which I think was partially to see how well we worked
      together. Luckily it all worked out and with $250k in the bank, it was
      time to take my startup full time.

      Getty Images was one suitor who was persistent, we chatted for months. I
      declined to move forward shortly after finalizing my seed round.
      iStockPhoto, a subsidiary of Getty, announced on their forums that they
      would be launching a competing service shortly after. Looking back, these
      could have also been fishing expeditions. Their competing service was not
      launched that I'm aware of, so they might have seen the writing on the
      wall before I did.

      IncSpring was a marketplace for unused logos and domain names. My office
      was my 2001 Ford Explorer. While working my full-time banking gig, I’d sit
      on my laptop outside of a nearby coffee shop with wifi that reached the
      parking lot. I designed the first front-end myself and worked with a firm
      to build the backend. They were a fantastic dev shop based in Ukraine. I
      never actually spoke to them, everything happened via Skype and email. I
      literally have never heard any of their voices to this day.

      At the time was the youngest VP in the bank. Regardless of the
      accomplishment, I quickly realized I was not cut out for banking. My job
      was to maintain a multi-million dollar commerical loan portfolio and find
      new businesses to loan money to. I was good at the maintaining, but not so
      much the sales part. I was much more interested in helping myself be an
      entrepreneur than someone else.

      Somehow I was the person that determined if businesses could repay
      multi-million dollar loans, without successfully repaying any loans
      myself. I was able to peek behind the curtains of startups, profitable
      businesses and many more that wouldn’t make it. I tended to spend my time
      thinking about the business as a concept and what could be done to improve
      on their ideas. The bank thought my time was better served looking at the
      actual numbers, doing actual forecasting. Meanwhile, I was making so
      little that I had a second job working the register at a driving range.

      My initial intention was to get a degree in marketing, but I changed
      majors when I realized how out of my league I was in Spanish 2. It's
      ironic that I couldn't tough out the marketing degree considering that's
      where my career ended up. Fortunately, UTSA just created the
      entrepreneurship track. I couldn't switch tracks fast enough, especially
      considering I was already writing business plans and dabbling in the worls
      of startups. That experience didn't always work in my favor, however. I
      once turned in my business plan for Fusion Boots as a final. I was certain
      I would ace that class. To my surprise, I received a "D" with a note
      saying I likely copied it from the internet. Go Runners!

      In addition to experiencing my first “real” job (not counting skating rink
      DJ or stocker at the GAP), I learned to operate a roller, front-end
      loader, shovel and a broom. We had up to 13 employees at one time and
      worked on some pretty cool projects. For example, JKS Contracting helped
      to put a basement into the Alamo. That's right, Pee Wee Herman's Big

      I started my first company building custom speed skating boots. In
      additional to learning in-home manufacturing (building boots out of carbon
      fiber, leather, and other synthetic materials), I learned the true power
      of the internet, sourcing inventory from Italy and Japan via email. In a
      move that would become the lynchpin for my career, I also taught myself
      design and web development because I couldn’t afford to hire anyone
      experienced. Was it successful? Product quality never got to where it
      needed to be and college became a startup "distraction". I sold one single
      pair of boots for $700.

      I opted to attend a magnet school that only accepted a limited number of
      students. The goal was to use the "elite" status as a way to beef up the
      college resume. Unfortunately, schools don't get excted about less than
      stellar GPAs. Fortunately, I made great friends and wouldn't change a
      thing. Plus, I won "Best Legs" in my class... it's in the yearbook so it's
      legit. How could I not be happy?!

      Not directly a career milestone, but it shaped my mindset. Gold medal in
      the 4000m two-man relay. We even set a national record (that would be
      beaten the following year.) Woohoo! In reality, the rest of the event was
      a disapointment. Why? That year, I trained at the US Olympic Training
      Center. I won or placed in every solo event I entered leading up to
      Nationals. I also became full of myself and slacked on training leading
      into Nationals. I didn't place in any individual events at Nationals.
